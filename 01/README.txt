Project 01
Participants: Tenzin Uden

I would like to acknowledge that Professor Stratton has helped me understand some of the ways to built the chips and also Mentor Sr.Ahmed has helped me find ways to approach in building the chips and hints that helped me figure out the chip formation. Without their support I wouldn't be able to complete this Project. I have had fun doing this project but it was also a very hard one, so I did learn a lot of the building blocks of computer fundamentals and how you can built a computer using different types chip!
